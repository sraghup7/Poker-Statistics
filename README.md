# POKER STATISTICS USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATION
This project includes analytical analysis and write a program that calculates the probabilities of 5-card poker hands. Unlike regular poker, cards will be drawn from a deck of 20 = 4x5 cards including 4 suites of the first 5 ranks: 1(Ace), 2, 3, 4, 5. These hands whose probabilities you will calculate are 
1. four of a kind 
2. one-pair 
3. two pair 
4. 3-of-a-kind
